# quotes-elsanti

Very simple CLI package to get a quote.

This is a simple project where I write a small JS program and:

* Create a Github repo - use git version control
* Publish to npm
* Test using different testing libraries
* Add continuous integration
* Use newest ES features
* Transpile with babel
* Bundle code with Webpack
* Get it ready for Node and Browser.

## Install and Execute
To execute it easily you could install it globally `npm i quotes-elsanti -g` just `npm i quotes-elsanti` and add to the path variable. Or 
execute as `./path/to/quotes-elsanti/index.js`.

Executing with the word full as `quotes-elsanti full` gives also the date. Otherwise just quote and author.
