# Micro

This is a simple project where I write a small JS program and:

* Create a Github repo - use git version control
* Publish to npm
* Test using different testing libraries
* Add continuous integration
* Use newest ES features
* Transpile with babel
* Bundle code with Webpack
* Get it ready for Node and Browser.
